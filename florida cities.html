            North Florida Charm and Family Fun
            Bring the family to Jacksonville, home to more than a dozen museums exploring history, contemporary art and science. The lush Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens features more than 2,000 animals and 1,000 species of plants.<br>Tallahassee offers much variety in things to do aswell, including Museums, Wildlife Trails and Festivals. Come and try our most famous Museum "Goodwood Museum & Garden", or St. Marks Lighthouse located in St. Marks Wildife refuge, and of course the festivals come try our annual Shakespeare in the park.<br>
            If neither one of those interest you we always have Miami, offering some of the best night life in the country, aswell as some of the best food and beaches offered in the world, it is nothing short of spectacular.
